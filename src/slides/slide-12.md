## Parameters

Parameters are the smallest units of an ANN. They define the scale and complexity of a neural network.

## Types of Parameters

There are two kinds of parameters used in neural nets:

1. Hyperparameters
2. Trainable Parameters

## Hyperparameters

Hyperparameters are the secret sauce of ANNs. They are predefined values used to shape aspects of a neural net. Hyperparameters cannot be learned and are never adjusted.

Vertical:

## Types of Hyperparameters

Here are some common hyperparams:

- Learning Rate
- Batch Size
- Number of Hidden Layers
- Dropout Rate

Vertical:

## Trainable Parameters

Trainable parameters are initialized with random values and adjusted during training. Changing these values allows a neural net to perform differently. Trainable parameters are often just called parameters.

## Types of Trainable Parameters

Here are the two most common types of parameters:

1. Weights
2. Biases
