Nodes are artificial neurons that process data units. They are defined in groups known as "layers". Neural networks are typically visualized in layers.

There are three components in a node:

- Inputs: One or more data units flowing into the node
- Activation: A function that transforms inputs to a singular non-linear output
- Output: The activated input flowing out of the node
